            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:28966:28"/> God promiſing the one, and threatning the other, yet to make this the ſole, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end of doing well and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding euill, is not to obey God for loue of him, whome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue our ſelues and all other things we ought to loue: but to obey God for our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and to preferre our ſelues before God. Now if God ſhould alwaies preſently reward godlineſſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently puniſh wickedneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the infirmity of man as now it is in his corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch is his weakeneſſe, that he would obey God, not for the loue of God (as Sathan falſely accuſed <hi>Iob</hi>

Thirdly, it cannot ſtand with the goodneſſe

The true loue of God &amp; our neighbour, iuſtice, patience, and ſuch like, are ſpirituall graces, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but with ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings be rewarded.

God therfore who doth al things in his iuſt order and due time, hath appointed their ſeaſons, when they both ſhall be rewarded. Wherefore you are not to determine of theſe matters, but leaue them to the iudgement of God.</p>

For proofe of this, I will inſtance but in two

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:28966:36"/> their being in heauen, only ſtay their motions, all things on earth would come to nothing.

The like may be ſaid in particular of euery ſtar in heauen: for if there were not a neceſſarie vſe of euery one of them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would it follow, that God had made ſome thing in vaine: the which you know is againſt a ground and principle in philoſophie, and therefore néedes not any farther proofe. Next vnto theſe, conſider the decent order of the elements, which as they are in dignitie one more excellent than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo according to their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:28966:37"/> are they placed one aboue another, this I knowe you are not ignorant of, being a matter agréed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by al Philoſophers.

Then the great commoditie thereof appeareth in the varietiy and vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of fiſhes in it, which as a common treaſurie for all

Now if you ſhould behold a goodlye houſe, curiouſly builded, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and garniſhed with all things which may delight the beholder, with fit and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent roomes for all neceſſarie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with conduits of water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery roome where it might néede, all things as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:28966:38"/> as wit and art can deuiſe, could you imagine that ſuch a houſe were compoſed by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? reaſon would conſtraine you to confeſſe, that the compoſer and builder thereof, was indued with great ſkill, art, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: how much more ſhould you (when you behold the great fabrike of the world) confeſſe the great power and wiſedome of God, were you not giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into a reprobate ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>co?

               <p>Sir, you muſt vnderſtande that particular thinges are made for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good of the vniuerſall, and parts are made for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good of the whole. As for example; Man is not made for the vſe of his hands, eyes, legges, or any of his members: but his hands are made for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of his whole body, his eyes to direct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body, the legges to beare the whole body: no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is made for the vſe of it ſelfe only. Now if the imperfection of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in that they are ſubiect to corruption and decay, make more for the good of the whole, then if there were no imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then it becommeth the maker of the whole, more to reſpect the good of the whole, then the particular, and make particulars ſubiect to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:28966:42"/> for the good of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole, and to perſiſt in your owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> builder of an houſe reſpect particulars in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regard of the whole? doth he not cutte downe many a trée for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this houſe? doth he not digge out many a ſtone out of the earth? doth he not breake him into many péeces vntill he be fit for his building? doe not builders of a Citie the like? they will hew in péeces and breake goodly trées, and great ſtones for the good of building: and why ſhold it ſéeme ſtrange to you, that God ſhould make particulars ſubiect to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the good of the whole? Now this rapier being a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the whole, was not made for his owne ſake, but for the general vſe of man. And more good ariſeth out of this,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:28966:42"/> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was made ſubiect to ruſt, corruption, breaking, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, than if it ſhould be made (as you would haue it) eternal; &amp; that for many manifeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, God who created al the world, he and all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the world for the vſe of man, foreſéeing the fall of man, and that he would dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that goodnes wherin he created him; in his iuſtice, againſt the diſobedience of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prouided this as a puniſhment for his tranſgreſſion, that hée ſhould earne his liuing with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſweate of his browes. Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary therefore it was, that hée ſhould prouide ſomthing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſhould labour. Now, if God ſhould haue made this ſo perfect in all reſpects, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhold neuer take ruſt, or any way be ſubiect to decay; if our appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:28966:43"/> were of ſuch mettall, that it would neuer weare out; if our houſes were ſuch, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wold neuer decay; if our land would neuer bring forth wéedes, but alwayes good corne of his owne accord, as you would haue all theſe and all other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to be of ſuch perfection as being once created or made, they ſhould euer endure. Then hereby you would take away the iuſtice of God againſt the ſinne, and the diſobedience of man againſt God: who for his tranſgreſſion hath appointed this labour on theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to kéepe theſe things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and that by his labor herein, he might get his liuing by the ſweate of his browes. Secondly, if theſe particulars which are made for the good of the whole, were not ſubiect to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:28966:43"/> alteration, if houſes, apparell, and ſuch like, would neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay being once made, infinite inconueniences would follow thereby. For notwithſtanding they do now decay, yet (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world béeing ſo full of people, which alſo God foreſaw, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prouided for it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) you ſée what daylie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints the poore ſort of people doe make, that they are out of worke. The Carpenter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Taylor, and ſuch like trades men, who are ouer char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with wife and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how much leſſe ſhould theſe poore men according to the ordinance of God, gette their liuing for themſelues, and their houſhold, if houſes once made would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer decay, if apparell, and ſuch like neceſſaries for the vſe of man, ſhould neuer weare out.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:28966:44"/> So that you may ſée, that theſe things being made for the vſe of man, and not man for them; God hath made them more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall for the vſe of man in making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubiect to change, than if he had made them dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for euer. Thirdly, God knowing the weakeneſſe and infirmitie of mans corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that as water, if it ſtand ſtill, it will corrupt and gather putrifaction, but if it be alway running, it continueth pure: ſo the minde of man, if it bée i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, it will bring forth corrupt fruit; but if it be buſied on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt labour, it is frée from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and lewd thoughts, &amp; frée from euill workes. Therefore God appointeth men to labour on mutable &amp; changeable met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that their labour ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be at an end, neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:28966:44"/> them thereunto, elſe would they be idle, and being i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, would waxe wicked. Thus God who firſt appointed labor vnto man for his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, turneth it into a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that whilſt men continue labouring painefully in their vocation, they are frée from occaſions of ſinne, &amp; God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their labours both with te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirtuall bleſſings; temporall, as health &amp; wealth, whereas contrariwiſe, they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are idle are neither healthy, nor wealthy. With ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in this world, as with good thoughts, good conſcience, and many other graces of the minde: and in the world to come, God in Chriſt will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, becauſe they haue walked according to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, painefully in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:28966:45"/> Concerning the other part of your Obiection, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes thunder, wind, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt breake forth, and vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable weather, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great hurt of mankind: You muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the things which God created for man, haue a double vſe, a principall, and a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vſe: the principall vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, is to profit man according to their manifold and ſeuerall vertues giuen to them of God in their firſt creation.<note place="margin">Pſal. 11.</note> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary vſe of them is, to bée inſtruments of Gods iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt man, if he diſobey his Maker, contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and properties in their firſt inſtitution. That as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who was made to obey his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, beginneth to diſobey him that made him, and degenerate from his principall end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:28966:46"/> that theſe calamities proceed from the wrath of God. Likewiſe the <hi>Grecians</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged theſe accidents to be the ſpeciall puniſhment of God for the offences of men, as you may ſée in Poets; when as the whole Nauie was ſtayed at the Ile <hi>Aulis, <hi>Agamemnon</hi>
                  </hi> the Generall ſendeth to <hi>Calcas</hi> the Prieſt, to know wherein the Gods were offended, and what might appeaſe their wrath? vnderſtanding the true cauſe of it, and that they ſhould not appeaſe the wrath of their Gods, except hee ſacrificed his Daughter <hi>Iphiginie,</hi> he ſpareth not his daughter to appeaſe their ire. When <hi>Pharao</hi> was puniſhed with Lice, Frogges, haileſtones, and his cattell and people with mortality, then he acknowledged the power of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:28966:46"/> God, then he deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would pray to God to take away thoſe plagues from him.

Here you ſée an other great commoditie ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto mankind by theſe things which you call euils; For by theſe extraordinarye puniſhments, men are mooued to fly vnto God for ſuccor, yea euen wicked men, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in their ſecurity neuer thinke on God, but continue ſtill in their wickedneſſe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Ionas</hi> fled by ſea from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God (as he thought) &amp; God ſtirred vp a great tempeſt, then the Marriners prayed to

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in proſperity, they ſeldom, careleſſely, and for faſhion or cuſtome ſake, repeate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of ordinarye prayer without thought of God. Now, though theſe euils as you terme them are grieuous for the preſent time, yet conſidering the profit they bring vnto man, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they cauſe men to flie vnto God, and ſéeke ſuccor and ayde at his hande, they cauſe vs to pray ſincerely, hartily, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently vnto God, they cauſe vs to enter into examination of our former life, wherein wée haue offended God, and mooued his wrath againſt vs, though theſe things ſeem grieuous and fearefull for the time, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not they properly be termed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,

                  </gap>e neither can, nor will, hée is both weake and enuious. But weaknes nor enuy cannot be in God, if there be any; for if there be a God, he muſt néedes be omnipotent and moſt good, or elſe no God. If he can &amp; wil, how commeth it to paſſe that ther are ſo many euils amongſt men? Firſt I grant that there are euils, and properly, euils the ſinnes of men, which God could take away, and therefore no weakeneſſe in him: but he doth not, not of enuie towards mankind, but for his greater good: and this is the reaſon why there are ſo many euils amongſt men. For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are euils, both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God, and the good of men, is made
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:28966:55"/> more manifeſt: ſo that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtandeth with the glory or goodneſſe of God, to take them away, but to ſuffer them to bée. Now, to make this manifeſt vnto you, giue mee leaue to prooue, firſt that God is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of euils: ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly to ſhew whence they ſpring. For the firſt point, that God is not the Author of theſe euils; God, who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie is to communicate his goodneſſe to others, made the whole world that his creatures might participate of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Vnto the perfection whereof, it was behoouefull y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there ſhould be diuers degrées of different natures. He hath made foure degrées of things y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are in the world. The loweſt degrée whereof, hath only his being without life, without
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:28966:56"/> ſence or motion, without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and of this kinde are the foure Elements, Fire, Aire, Water, and the Earth. Of the ſecond degrée, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re thoſe things which beſide their being haue life; as trées, flowers of the field, which ſomtimes grow and increaſe, ſometimes die. A third kind are they which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their being, and life, haue alſo ſence, motion, able to moue from place to place, as beaſts, foules, fiſh. The fourth and higheſt degrée haue beſids theſe things before mentioned, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and wiſdome: and in this degrée of creatures, are onelye men &amp; Angels. In theſe foure degrées are comprehended al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures that God hath made, and all theſe were created good. Now, euils haue no place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the things created, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:28966:56"/> can it, becauſe it hath no eſſence or being in it ſelfe, but is a defect of that good which ſhould be in things created, by the default of the creature, and not of the Creator. As blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a defect of the eyes, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe an indiſpoſition and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with their qualities w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould be in the body, whereby the members of the body are not able fréely to execute their functions. Yet becauſe euils ſerue for the greater commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of thoſe things that are good; and things good, do more apparantly ſhew their goodnes by comparing them with euils, as ſickneſſe once tryed, maketh health to be more gratefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; meates are then moſt ſwéete vnto vs, when wée haue béene long hungrie; the light
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:28966:57"/> more pleaſant vnto vs, &amp; better welcome after much darkenes, heauie, and gloomie wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore although God doth not cauſe them, yet he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth them not, but ſuffereth them to haue a kinde of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie on his creatures, for the greater good of the vniuerſall: yet thus far he hindreth euils to be; that they breake not out, but when, and where he liſt: elſe would the malice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and wicked men quicklie bring all things to naught: hée gouerneth, and guideth them for his owne glory, and good of his owne elect: for he would no way ſuffer them to be, except he vſed them to good purpoſe; for the puniſhment of the wicked to ſhew his iuſtice, and for the furtherance and behalfe of his elect. This being ſhewen, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:28966:57"/> God is not the author of them, and that they haue no béeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the workes of God, but are blemiſhes and defects of things created; it now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſhewe you the firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe from whence they came, which was the frée will of man wilfully diſobeying his creator, who had this excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gift beſtowed on him, that hée had an ability, frée wil, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er either to obey his maker; or if he would, diſobey him: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his maker conſiſted his felicitie; in diſobeying, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and woe. All the ſinnes in the world (which only can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called euill, excepting the diſobedience of the Diuell) procéede from the frée will of man. There is no cruelty, no adultery, oppreſſion, hatred, malice, or in a word, no ſinne,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:28966:58"/> but procéedeth from the frée wil of man. But you ſay, why doth God ſuffer cruelty, oppreſſion, and wrong, as that heroicall <hi>Brutus,</hi> or ſincere <hi>Cato</hi> ſhould bee continually oppugned all their life long?

To the firſt I anſwere, that if God ſhould haue ſuffered no oppreſſor of his common wealth to haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Brutus</hi> his time, how ſhould <hi>Brutus</hi> haue ſhewed his vertues, in withſtanding Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? if there had liued no wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lewd perſon in <hi>Catoes</hi> time, <hi>Cato</hi> could not haue bin ſo vertuous. Who ſo wil take away al wickedneſſe, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent taketh away vertue; for vertue conſiſteth in rooting out vice: where there is no wrong

Againe, God ſuffereth wicked <hi>Dioniſius, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus,</hi> and ſuch like, to liue here on earth happily, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of iudgement they might bée without excuſe;<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18 Pſal. 17.14</note> and <hi>this is their portion</hi> of ioyes which euer they ſhall haue: ſo that we néede not enuie their ſhort felicitie, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the euerlaſting paines they are to endure.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:28966:59"/> goodneſſe before they fell from the good eſtate wherein God created them. There is no wicked man ſo abſolutely bad, but that at ſome time or other, hath at the leaſt ſome ſhew or ſhadowe of ſome vertue or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: now ſuch is the loue of God vnto vertues, that he will bleſſe with temporall bleſſings euen the ſhadowes of vertue.

               <p>Why, doe you think it reaſon, that when God had beſtowed on man free will, whereby hee had power either to honour his Maker, or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him at his will; That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſhould be left free without puniſhment, if he would (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power to doe it) bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to God, or diſhonour his Maker? Is it ill to be bound to doe well hauing power ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to performe it, as <hi>Adam</hi> had? Doe Princes ill, who make good laws for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, which they know will ſomtimes be broken? The lawes which Princes make for the good of their common wealth, are very many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Some very hard to bée obſerued: the weakneſſe and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:28966:64"/> frailety of men ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is now very great: yet you cannot iuſtlie finde fault with Princes, for making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good lawes, (without which a common wealth ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand) though they knowe they will be broken: much leſſe can you iuſtly find fault with God, who gaue but one lawe to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; ſuch a law as was very eaſie to be obſerued: neither was he hindred with any frailty as we are, but was endued with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graces wherof we haue not as yet taſted. Beſides this, as God foreſaw the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſo did hee prouide in his mercy, and not for any deſert of man, a remedy for it, euen his only begotten ſonne Ieſus Chriſt for a redemption for our ſinne, that we by repentance &amp; faith in Ieſus Chriſt, might
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:28966:64"/> attaine remiſſion for our ſins. Neither would God haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Adam</hi> to haue fallen, but that by the conſequent thereof, he intended of his goodneſſe to turne it to the greater good of almankind. Had not <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many excellent vertues which now appeare in man, could not haue bin, they could haue had no place or vſe in the ſtate of innocency, fortitude &amp; courage, patience, loue of our enemies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy &amp; ſuch like, are excellent vertues. All theſe haue no place in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. How can fortitude &amp; courage be ſhewen, wher there is no reſiſtance? Now, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſhewe their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in reſiſting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> il practiſes of wicked men, &amp; reſiſting temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. How can patience bee ſhewed where there is no wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:28966:65"/> done? now the elect of God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer patiently many oppreſſions, yea they pray for their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, that God would giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repentance, they patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hunger and thirſt, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſickneſſe, and ſuch like. How can the excellencie of loue and charitie be ſhewen, if wée had no enmies, whoſe wrongs and iniuries through charitie we pardon and forgiue? How could pittie and compaſſion be ſhewed, if there were none in miſery, or néeded our help? how could abſtinence be ſhewed, if there were no alluring baites in the world; or our vnbridled luſts did not tempt vs to doe that which we ſhould not doe? Reaſon it was, that <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> ſhold haue ſome matter wherein hée ſhould ſhew his obedience to his Maker, and acknowledge
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:28966:65"/> Gods ſoueraintie ouer him, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could not hee, except hee were bound to ſome dutie or other. Againe, had not <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, where could Gods iuſtice in iuſtlie puniſhing wickedneſſe, appeare? his mercy could haue had no matter wherin it might appeare, as now it doth, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning offendors, in deliuering the afflicted out of miſery. How ſhould the greatneſſe of Gods loue towards men be knowen, who ſpared not his only belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Sonne to redéeme man being fallen, for whoſe ſake, we ſhall obtaine not an earthly paradiſe, but the euerlaſting kingdome of heauen, farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding the happineſſe of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe? In theſe, and the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the Fathers terme the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> a happie fall; not that <hi>Adam</hi> did well in diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:28966:66"/> God. But for the euent, becauſe God of his mercy hath turned this fall and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to mans greater good, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſinne which in it ſelfe is bad, to ſerue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of his owne glory, and the good of man.

                  </hi> a law w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew he would break; &amp; in not hindring him to fal, though he could haue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:28966:66"/> hindred him. <hi>Adam</hi> only iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is to be blamed, who wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended. God made <hi>Adam</hi> of that excellencie, that beſides the great felicity he gaue him, gaue him alſo abilitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, hee might haue continued therein. God now permitteth ſinnes which hée could hinder; yet hée doth not hinder them, not for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he liketh or alloweth of them, but for the greater good of his elect. For when as any of his elect are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken with ſinne, their fall doth make them knowe their owne weakeneſſe, &amp; how fraile they are of themſelues without the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of God: if God ſhold not ſomtimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his aſſiſting grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his elect, and leaue them to their owne ſtrength, but continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vphold them from falling,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:28966:67"/> they would waxe prowd, and aſcribe that vnto themſelues, which procéedeth from the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall aſſiſtance of God, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that in that they perſiſted in integrity, it were by their owne proper power, and not by the ſpeciall grace of God. Wherefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, I dare confidently affirme, that it is good for the elect of God, ſometimes to fall, that thereby they may be humbled, and that they might acknowledge their owne weakeneſſe, and ſéeke vnto God by hartie prayer, for his eſpeciall aſſiſtance. Beſides this, they who haue beene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with ſinne, by knowing the frailty of man, are more prone to haue compaſſion on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like infirmities in their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.<note place="margin">Virg.</note>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:28966:69"/> brother, ſome of them ment to take his life from him, all of them agreed to ſell him to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of farre countreys, neuer to be hard of againe, being carried away as a bondſlaue. How was he wronged by falſe accuſation, impriſoned as a malefactor, though he was none; his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the meane time who did him this wronge, liued at eaſe and pleaſure? How doth the eſpeciall care of God here appeare? <hi>Dauid</hi> was an elect you cannot denie, a man according to Gods owne hart, how was he hunted from place to place, conſtrained to flee to his enemies, and there fayne himſelfe madde to ſaue his life, conſtrayned to liue in wilderneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in holes and caues, and yet there not ſecure? but as a Foxe ſtill purſued, hated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled of the wicked.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it is moſt true, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked haue beſtowed on them, more wealth, health of body, honours, and worldly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, then are beſtowed on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, yet Sathan who ruleth in them, and their owne inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections, turne theſe bleſſings of God to their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vexation. Contrariwiſe, albeit the godly haue many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations laid on them, yet ſuffer they leſſe vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe, then doe the wicked in their greateſt proſperities. Nay further, the godly reioyce in tribulation, knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuch chaſtiſements are tokens of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:28966:85"/> Gods fauours, who not only foreſéeth all things, but alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of al things, with whoſe goodneſſe it cannot ſtande, that any thing ſhould happen vnto thoſe that ſeriouſly obey him, which make not for their good. This vndoubted perſwaſion of the faithful, cauſeth them with ioy to endure any tribulation, which it pleaſeth God to lay on them, and to bee contented with any eſtate wherein God hath appointed them to liue in, knowing that that cannot bee bettered, which he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee done: and therefore they murmour not at any thing that betide them, nor ſéek vnlawful meanes to alter their eſtate, though it be very baſe &amp; meane. As much therefore as contentment of minde, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcontentment of mind,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:28966:85"/> ſo much better is the eſtate of the godly in this life, then the eſtate of the vngodly. Vngodly men I confeſſe, abound in wealth, honours, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but none of theſe doe make men better, or vertuous: the faithfull for the moſt part want theſe temporall bleſſings, but God enricheth them with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſings, be maketh them excell in vertue, which maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſſeſſors thereof good, and of greater eſtimation and value, then al the earthly treaſures in the world. Wherefore you ſée how farre you are deceaued, in ſaying that the eſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this life, is ſo miſerable by reaſon of ſo manifold afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which happen vnto them, that it were better not to bee at all, then to bee ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: God neuer layeth greater
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:28966:86"/> tribulation on any of his elect, then they are able to beare: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible therefore it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there ſhold be any man ſo miſerable, as that it were better hee had neuer béene borne.</p>

               <p>True, hee ſaith ſo of <hi>Iudas,</hi> but in ſaying ſo, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contradicteth my poſition, nor prooueth your opinion: hée ſpeaketh not there of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of affliction; for <hi>Iudas</hi> then was in no kinde of affliction (of which kinde of miſery you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that it were better not to be, then endure, which I deny)
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:28966:86"/> but he ſpeaketh of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of an obſtinate and impenitent ſinner. You muſt therefore conſider, that there is a double kinde of miſery; <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria culpae, &amp; miſeria afflictionis.</hi> I grant that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſerable eſtate of an impenitent ſinner is ſo badde, that it were better not be, then to be ſuch a one. This maketh nothing againſt my poſition, but to ſuffer the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of affliction, be it neuer ſo great, is better then not to bée at all. For you know that it is a poſition amongſt all the learned, that <hi>Ens &amp; bonum cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertuntur.</hi> Whatſoeuer is, or hath a being hath ſome degrée of goodneſſe; but that which hath no being, can haue no part of goodneſſe: and therefore it is better to bee miſerable in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in this world, then

                  <hi>But this reaſon alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that it is better to be in the miſerable eſtate of the wicked, then not to bee at all.

               <p>True it is their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being is better to bee, them not to be at all, in reſpect of the whole; but not in reſpect of themſelues. For their being doth more ſet forth the glory of God, and further the good of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elect, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they were not. How could y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſtice of God be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, if there were no wicked men, or ill ſpirits on whom his iuſtice might be executed? How could the loue and goodneſſe of God be ſufficiently knowen in protecting his elect from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:28966:87"/> and wicked men,<note place="margin">Vide Aug. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de. li. arbitr.</note> if there were no ſuch, which made op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt his elect and choſen? therefore there is good vſe of them vnto the whole. But in reſpect of themſelues, it were better (through their own default) that they had neuer bin: and therefore Chriſt our Sauiour ſaith not ſimply of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> that it were better he had neuer béene borne; but it were better for <hi>Him,</hi> that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer béene borne. For if it had not béene good either in reſpect of himſelfe, or of the whole, that he ſhould be borne, hee ſhould neuer haue béene; for God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth nothing but to ſome good purpoſe. But our Sauiour ſaith of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that it had béene better for <hi>Him,</hi> that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer béene borne, as it may bee ſaid of all the wicked, in reſpect
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:28966:88"/> of themſelues, it had béene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had neuer béene borne, by reaſon of the euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which by their iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, they are to endure. But neceſſary it was, that there ſhould be a <hi>Iudas,</hi> and wicked men. For, who but a wicked <hi>Iudas</hi> would euer attempt the betraying the Sonne of God, into the hands of his enemies? who, but wicked men would hier for monie falſe witneſſes to accuſe our Sauiour Chriſt &amp; of malice and enuie put the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent to death? Theſe are neceſſarie executioners of the will of God, though they doe theſe things not to fulfill the will of GOD, but mooued thereunto, by their owne ill affections, and drawe on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſuch miſeries, that it were better for them, that they

                  <hi>Well, ſay that theſe words are to bee vnderſtood of ſinne, and not of the miſery of the afflictions which ordinarily come vnto thoſe whome you cal the elect of God. I am ſure you will not denie, but that <hi>Paul</hi> was one of theſe elect: and yet hee ſaith of himſelfe, and generally of all thoſe that profeſſe Chriſt, that in reſpect of the miſeries of afflictions which happen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this world, they be of all men moſt miſerable: which directly prooueth my aſſertion, &amp; cleane ouerthroweth all that you haue ſpoken.</hi>

               <p>Nay, you wreſt the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to your purpoſe, contrary to their ſence, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that without exception, which he affirmeth with excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſaying,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.19.</note> 
                  <hi>If in this life only we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:28966:89"/> haue hope in Chriſt, we were of all men moſt miſerable:</hi> which is a moſt true ſpéech; out of w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you would conclude, that which is moſt falſe. For as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, if our hopes in Chriſt were bounded in the limits of this preſent life, ſurely none ſo miſerable as a true Chriſtian, on whome for the moſt part, greateſt afflictions fall. But this hope in Chriſt altereth the miſery of afflictions which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on them, as a pleaſant ſauce altereth the taſte of harſh meates, &amp; cauſeth that which in his owne nature is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauourie, to ſeeme very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſwéete. Take away this pleſant ſauce, and harſh and vnpleaſant meates, will be offenſiue to our taſte: and take away hope in Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a true Chriſtian, and he will be of all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:28966:89"/> creatures moſt miſerable: this hope maketh ſower afflictions ſéeme pleaſant. For he that is a true Chriſtian, knoweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all afflictions come by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God; he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the goodneſſe of God, who layeth no affliction on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his elect, but for their good, either to exerciſe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and other vertues, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their laſciuious natures, which otherwiſe in proſperitie would grow vitious: or to ſtir vp in them their hartie and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous prayers, who otherwiſe would careleſlie and ſeldome thinke on him, or ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider &amp; remember that he is the gouerner of all things. Or if in particular they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture the cauſe why God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth them: yet they vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly know, that God wil turne
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:28966:90"/> them to their good; and therfore they willingly &amp; ioyfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them. They know that their corrupt nature néede ſuch medicines to kéepe them in the true obedience of Gods will: therefore are ſuch afflictions welcome vnto them. They know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God <hi>receaueth no ſonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>but whome he correcteth:</hi> and that <hi>they are baſtard ſons whom he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth not.</hi> Wherefore with ioy they endure them as ſpecial notes, and arguments of Gods loue towards them. Thus you ſée that farre happier is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the godly euen in this life, then the eſtate of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. For the godly enioy ſincere gladneſſe of hart, euen in the middeſt of tribulation: but the wicked in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt iollitie haue feares &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfulneſſe which marre their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:28966:90"/> mirth: they haue (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith) a continuall feare ſounding in their eares,<note place="margin">2. Corin. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>they reioyce in the face, but not in the heart:</hi> it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſincere. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe God as a louing &amp; careful father ouer his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath appointed vnto euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in particular, a Tutor or Schoolemaſter continually to watch ouer him, (I mean, hath placed a conſcience in euery man) who not onely ſheweth him, and continually aduiſeth him to embrace that which is good, but alſo when hee hath done well, doth glad him with preaſent delight, in that he hath done well; and alſo filleth him full of good hopes to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his well doing: ſo that there is no man, but feeleth this in himſelfe when he hath well done a reioycing that hee hath
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:28966:91"/> done well, and that his good hopes are encreaſed, as I ſaid before. But contrariwiſe, this conſcience diſſwadeth vs from doing euill, and if wee diſobey him, hee layeth before vs the iudgment of God: No man can deny his doome, but is conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confeſſe, that he which euil doth, deſerueth puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, himſelfe being iudge: Hence ſpringeth feares, miſtruſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a continuall expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of puniſhments due vnto his offences. Wherefore moſt vnhappie is the eſtate of the wicked, who in this life neuer enioy any ſincere ioy, but ſuch as is mixed with feare, and in the life to come, are to endure vnſpeakeable and endleſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

For in reſpect of their bodies, their condition is both alike, they both are made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, they both continue their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, by the benefite of the ayre, their breath is in their noſtrels, &amp; as their bodies are made of the earth, ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to earth againe when they die: all their vegetatiue &amp; ſenſitiue faculties, doe then end when they die.

                  <hi>Well ſir, I cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from gathering a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Salomons</hi> words, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their ſence. <hi>Salomon</hi> was wiſe enough to expreſſe his own meaning. He ſaith plainely, that there is no excellencie in man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue beaſts; you ſay the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Here you ſtand not to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet you would haue me beleeue Scripture. I for my part haue great reaſon to ſet by the opinion of <hi>Salomon,</hi> becauſe he was the wiſeſt man that euer was, or euer ſhal be; &amp; in matters
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:28966:95"/> of difficulty, wee ought to giue credit to wiſe men.</hi>

               <p>It is well that now you vrge the authoritie of the Scripture, if in ſhew it ſéeme any way to fauour your error; &amp; now you haue reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue <hi>Salomon,</hi> becauſe he was the wiſeſt man that euer was: but if Scripture, or wiſe men be againſt you, you will ſtand to neither.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Trau.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay, ſay not ſo; though I yeeld not to the authority of Scripture, yet I aſcribe much vnto the opinion of wiſe men.</hi>

               <p>Then ſtand to your words. Now I wil ſhew you euidently by the very words of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that he compareth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and beaſt, but only in things
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:28966:96"/> viſible, and no further: ſo that it is not my bare coniecture what he meaneth, but his own words do ſufficiently manifeſt this to bee his meaning: héere take the Bible, read the words going next before thoſe you haue alleadged, or heare them read. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaking in the verſe before of the condition of men, ſaith, <hi>To ſee to,</hi> they are as beaſts: for the condition of the children of men, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of beaſts are euen one. Now the words going before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimony you alledge, doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt wherein hee compareth them.<note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> Namely, <hi>To ſee to,</hi> and he giueth inſtance in things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as dying, and breathing: and thus farre, and herein they are both alike. Now, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a doubtfull text, the beſt way ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:28966:96"/> that which goeth before, &amp; that which followeth, which if you had obſerued, you would neuer haue alleadged theſe words of <hi>Salomon</hi> for your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Now, to put the matter out of all doubt, that <hi>Salomon</hi> acknowledgeth the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoule, heare his words, ſpeaking of the death of man, &amp; what followeth, he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>dust returneth to the earth whence it came,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. Cap. 12.7.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; the ſpirit returneth to God that gaue it.</hi> Here he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth diſtinctly of the body and ſoule of man: of the body, as he affrmed in the wordes which you alleaged, that it dyeth and returneth to the earth, as doe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carkaſſes of beaſts: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule doth not ſo, it goeth to God, who gaue it. Now, <hi>Salomon</hi> was the wiſeſt man that euer was, as you acknowledge, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:28966:97"/> in matters of difficulty, wee ought to giue credence to the wiſeſt men, and this you will ſtand to, acknowledge now your errour.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon <hi>only affirmeth this, he giueth no reaſon for it. Now, if wiſe men varie in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſome of them giue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their opinion, and ſome only affirme, ſhewing no reaſon; I will beleeue thoſe who ſhewe reaſon, more then the bare aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any. You know</hi> Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>was an admirable wiſe man, whoſe learning all men iuſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and reuerence, who alſo concerning this point, hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten three bookes, and by many reaſons diſcourſeth of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hath laboured much in ſearching of the truth herein, yet he affirneth the contrarye: therfore you muſt pardon me if I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:28966:97"/> diſſent from</hi> Salomon, <hi>who hath not laboured ſo farre in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>hath.</hi>

               <p>It is well, as long as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſéemed to deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoule, he was the wiſeſt man that euer was, or ſhall be, and then you had great reaſon to beléeue him: but now it is prooued, that hee taught the contrary; now you haue found a wiſer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> now is not to be beleued, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe he only affirmeth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoule, but by reaſon proueth it not; as thogh wiſe men would affirme anye thing without any ground of reaſon. In that he onely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it, you imagine, that hee had reaſon ſo to doe, elſe you denie him to bee a wiſe man. But I doubt not, but that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> will bee of as ſmall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

                  <hi>It is a poſition in <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> that whatſoeuer hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hath an end; but the ſoule hath a beginning, therfore it hath an end. A ſecond reaſon is this, euery naturall forme is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with that whereof it is the forme, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phiſico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> 4. <hi>text.</hi> 17. but the ſoule, or life of man, is the naturall forme of man. As <hi>Ariſtole</hi> affirmeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de anima, text.</hi> 17. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when man dieth, his ſoule alſo dyeth with him. Both the <hi>maior,</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> are the very words of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude directly <hi>ex praemiſis.</hi> A third moſt euident reaſon I take out of the eight booke of <hi>Ariſtotle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natura animalium. cap.</hi> 1. where
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:28966:98"/> he ſayth, that the life or the ſoule of a man in his childhoode diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the life of beaſts but the life of beaſts are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, therfore the ſoule of man is not immortall. A fourth reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I gather out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

               <p>Many excellent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers haue ſearched into the nature of the ſoule of man, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and written of it, who giue excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reaſons to ſhew the immortality of it, as <hi>Hermes Treſmagiſtus.

               <p>Well then, now I come to anſwere your reaſons out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and firſt before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in particular to any of your reaſons, I muſt tell you this in generall, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:28966:99"/> doth not in his three bookes <hi>de anima,</hi> ſpeake of the ſubſtance and eſſence of the ſoule of man, but of his faculties, powers, &amp; operations, in which reſpect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule is ſaid to be the naturall forme of man, and <hi>actus corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris:</hi> as for the ſubſtance and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſoule, becauſe it is a ſpirituall ſubſtance, and not a naturall facultie of the body, therefore it pertayneth not to naturall philoſophy to handle it. This I ſpeake not vppon coniecture, but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in plaine termes telleth you this, in his ſecond booke <hi>de ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> the ſecond chapter, the laſt words of the chapter. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if you wil beléeue <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> him ſelfe expounding himſelfe, you muſt vnderſtand whatſoeuer he ſaith in his thrée bookes <hi>de anima,</hi> to be ſpoken of the vegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:28966:100"/> and ſenſible life of men and beaſts, and not of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall, and reaſonable ſoule of man; and he giueth a reaſon why in thoſe books he ſpeaketh not of it, becauſe ſaith he, the intellectuall &amp; reaſonable ſoule or life of man, is a certaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſubſtance ſubſiſting of it ſelfe, ſeparable from the body, and in this reſpect, not <hi>actus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris,</hi> not the naturall forme of the body: and the better to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his meaning, he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſoule of a man in the body, to a Marriner in a ſhip. As a Marriner is of a different nature from the ſhip, ſubſiſting of himſelfe: ſo is the ſoule of man in the body, of a different nature from the body, of a far more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nature ſubſiſting of it ſelfe. As the Marriner gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth motion vnto the ſhip, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:28966:100"/> directeth it this way, and that way, whither ſo euer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to ſaile: ſo the ſoule of man, guideth the body whither it pleaſeth him to goe. As the Marriner hath a vigilent care and loue to his ſhippe, to ſée to it, that it take no harme, &amp; repayreth the decayes of it: ſo the ſoule careth for the good of the body, cauſeth it to decline from thoſe things which are hurtful for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, &amp; by his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and vegitable faculties, daylie repayreth the decaying body. As the Marriner doth not decay with his ſhip, but is ſafe and ſound, though his ſhip leake, or by reaſon of age rotte away: ſo neither is the ſoule of man any whitte the worſe, though his body decay &amp; turne to corruption. This in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall might ſuffice to anſwere
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:28966:101"/> all which might be brought out of <hi>Arilio les</hi> books <hi>de anima:</hi> but becauſe you ſhal haue no cauil, I will in particular anſwere euerie one of your arguments. This is your firſt argument. Whatſoeuer hath a beginning, hath an end. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoul of man hath a beginning, therefore it hath an end. I graunt your whole ſillogiſme to be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true without exception, in thinges whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this generall <hi>Maxime;</hi> Namely in things natural, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the foure elements, but the reaſonable and intellectuall ſoule of man, is not a naturall thing compoſed of the foure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, therefore this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ariſtotle, <hi>VVhatſoeuer hath a beginning hath an end,</hi>
                  </hi> maketh nothing againſt the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:28966:101"/> immortalitie of the ſoule, albeit it hath a beginning. Your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon is this. Euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural forme is corruptible with that wherof it is a forme. But the ſoule of man is the naturall forme of man, therefore when man dyeth, the ſoule dieth alſo. To this I anſweare, that the reſonable ſoule of man may be conſidered 2. waies, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his eſſence, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his operations, powers, and faculties: his operations alſo are of 2. kindes, whereof ſome are ſuch, as the ſoule exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth without any inſtrument of the bodie, as his intellectuall powers, as for example; the ſoule of man iudgeth of truth and falſhood, diſcourſeth of the naturall cauſes of thinges, and by the effects of thinges ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth into the cauſes of things:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:28966:102"/> it diſcourſeth of celeſtiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and things inuiſible: theſe and the like operations y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule vſeth without any ayd or helpe of the body, and theſe remaine ſtill with the ſoule, though the body periſh: other faculties the ſoule exerciſeth in the body, and by the ayd of the bodie. In the bodie, when it giueth life vnto the bodye by his ſenſible and vegitable faculties; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of theſe his faculties and operations, the ſoule is truely ſaid to bée the naturall forme of man, and theſe ſenſible and vegitable operations of the ſoule, dye with the bodye. True therefore is your <hi>Maior</hi> Propoſition, that euery natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forme dyeth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is the forme; but this is nothing againſt the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoule, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:28966:102"/> is not properly the naturall forme of man in reſpect of his ſubſtance, but only in reſpect of ſome of his faculties, becauſe by his faculties it giueth life to man. But if you reſpect his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it is a ſpirituall ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſeparable from the body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeachment to his being; and in this reſpect it is not the naturall forme of man,<note place="margin">Arist. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de anima. c. <hi>1.</hi> vlt. verb. capitis.</note> as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelfe doth confeſſe: ſo that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> being your iudge, your argument is of no force. Your thirde reaſon is this, The ſoule, or life of man in his childhood, differeth nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the life of beaſts; but the liues of beaſts are not immortall, <hi>Ergo.</hi> I confeſſe, both the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior,</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> to be moſt true in that ſence as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, but not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſence whereunto you wreſt them.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:28966:103"/> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh in that place not of the eſſence of the ſoule,<note place="margin">Li. <hi>8.</hi> de nat. anim. ca. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> whether it bee corruptible, or immortall, but only of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of mans ſoule in his childhood; which as hee ſaith, differeth then nothing from beaſts, which is moſt true. Nay, I ſay further, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect beaſts are to be preferred before children. Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know not what is good or euil for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but beaſts naturally knowe what is good for them, &amp; what is ill for them, and they chuſe the one, and refuſe the other. But this aſſertion maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the immortality of the ſoule. Neither had <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> any intent to ſpeake of it in that place,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum.</note> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it will manifeſt vnto you, if you looke into it. Your fourth reaſon is this, No eternall
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:28966:103"/> thing can be a part of a mortal,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima. ca. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> or a corruptible thing, but the ſoule of man is a part of man: therefore it cannot be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Both <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> I confeſſe, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh therefore of the ſoule; if you reſpect his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a thing ſubſiſting by himſelfe, it is not a part of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body; but if you conſider his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration in giuing life to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is a part of mans body, &amp; is, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>actus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris,</hi> and the forme of the body. Now, that the ſoule according to his eſſence, is not a part of the body of man, but only in reſpect of his faculties and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe plainely confeſſeth in many places, as in his firſt booke <hi>de anima,</hi> he ſaith, that the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall life, or ſoule of man, is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:28966:104"/> contayned in no part of mans body, and that he is ſeparable from the body without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or hurt to his eſſence. This affirmeth he alſo in his ſecond booke <hi>de anima,</hi> in diuers places. And in his third booke <hi>de anima,</hi> he ſaith, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall part of the ſoule of man, procéedeth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the body, as all naturall formes doe: and therefore by conſequent it is eternall, and not ſubiect to corruption. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> therefore himſelfe being iudge, the intellectuall ſoule is not a part of the body, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome reſpect; as by his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it giueth life vnto man, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he not only affirmeth; but alſo explayneth his meaning by fit examples, by the example of a Marriner, which giueth moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Shippe, and directeth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:28966:104"/> it, but is no part of the Shippe: and by the example of a ſeale, which cauſeth a certaine forme in the waxe, but is no part of the waxe; You may bruſe the waxe together, and marre the forme imprinted by the ſeale, without any hurt at all to the ſeale: ſo may the body of man turne to corruption, whereunto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule giueth a naturall forme by his operation, yet without the hurt of the eſſence of the ſoule, becauſe it is a diuine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſubſiſting by it ſelfe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the body, by the confeſſion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe. Thus you ſee, your reaſon is of no force, by the opinion of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> on whome only you relie. Now, becauſe I will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you for your foure reaſons out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the immortality of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:28966:105"/> ſoule, I will requite you with foure more out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to prooue the immortality of the ſoule; and if néede were, I could double them, ſince in this point you relie ſo much on him. My firſt reaſon out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is this; God and nature (ſaith he) maketh nothing in vaine, but the ſoule of euery man, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſireth to be immortall, to liue continually in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting happineſſe; therefore is it immortall: elſe this naturall deſire of the ſoule, of being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingly in happineſſe, is made in vaine, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> denyeth. Other liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures appetites, runne on thoſe things which preſently they loue and like; their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons runne not on pleaſure to come, they conceaue not of any felicity after this life, much leſſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:28966:105"/> do they deſire it, for they know it not. God hath giuen to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature ſuch ſeuerall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and deſires, as are agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their ſeuerall natures: the Horſe deſireth not to flie, as God hath not giuen him meanes to flie: the fiſh deſireth not to walk on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land, or liue on the land, as God hath not giuen him meanes to walke, neither is able to liue out of the water; neither beaſts, fowles, or fiſhes, deſire to abound in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, gold, or ſiluer, ſith they haue no vſe of it. Generally, God indueth no creature with any naturall deſire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is not capable. Now then, ſith God hath indued the ſoule of euery man with a naturall deſire of continuing immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in euerlaſting hapines, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is capable of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:28966:106"/> to the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> who holdeth this as a ſure ground, that <hi>God and nature hath made nothing in vaine.</hi> My ſecond ground out of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> for the immortality of the ſoule is this, Whatſoeuer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed of the foure elements, is not corruptible, (for as he ſaith, the cauſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption procéedeth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of the elements where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are made) but the ſoule is not compoſed of the foure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements: therefore the ſoule is not corruptible, but immortall. Both the <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> therefore according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the ſoule is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. My third reaſon which I take out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is this, The intellectuall and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule of man, is a diuine ſubſtance, which hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:28966:106"/> ſeparable from the body, whoſe eſſence is not contayned in any part of the body, &amp; may be ſeparated from the body as a thing incorruptible, ſaith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle:</hi> whence I make this ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, whatſoeuer is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſubſtance ſeparable from the body, and incorruptible. Howſoeuer the body of man periſheth is immortal, but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſoule is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſubſtance contayned in no part of the body, ſeparable from the body, as an incorruptible thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a corruptible. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the ſoule is immortall. My fourth reaſon which I take out of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> is this: That ſubſtance whoſe operations depend not of the body, his eſſence depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of the body, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the ſoule of man
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:28966:107"/> dependeth not of the body, but of the ſpirituall and diuine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whoſe eſſence is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body; therfore it peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not with the body. Both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Maior</hi> &amp; <hi>Minor</hi> are <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proueth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the eyes of old men. If (ſaith he) an old man had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye of a child, hee would ſée as cléerely as a child, hereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, that the ſoule of man doth not impaire with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as in diuers diſeaſes it is manifeſt. When as the body is moſt weake, the faculties of the mind are moſt ſtronge; then the minde and ſoule of man moſt ſharply vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth any thing and is moſt iuditious, then his deſires are moſt vehement, and his loue to goodneſſe, &amp; miſlike of ſinne is moſt ardent: then that naturall inclination, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:28966:107"/> deſire of being euerlaſtingly in felicity, doe moſt ſhew it ſelfe. Which naturall affection and appetite of the ſoule were in vaine, if the ſoule of man were not capable of immortality, which is a thing flatly denyed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that God ſhould giue any naturall deſire to any thing in vaine. Beſides theſe and many more arguments w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I could bring out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there are diuers other reaſons which might be brought for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proofe of this point, as that it cannot ſtand with the iuſtice of God, that the ſoule of man ſhould periſh with his body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as there are many who haue ſeriouſly worſhipped him and haue paſſed their liues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeable to his will, yet worſe hath betide them, then hath happened vnto thoſe that haue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:28966:108"/> diſhonoured him: ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, many in this life haue liued moſt lewdly, yet haue ſpent all their daies in great proſperity, inriched with great wealth, &amp; dignified with great honours. Wherefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there muſt be a life to come, wherein the one is to be puniſhed, and the other rewarded. It cannot ſtand with the mercy of God, that the ſoule ſhold periſh with the body, ſince he made man y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellenteſt creature in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world whom he loueth aboue all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for whoſe ſake hee made all the world, and indued him with more ſpeciall graces then all creatures, euen in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner equal to Angels: and when he fel from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellency wherin he created him, ſpared not his only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sonne to redéeme
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:28966:108"/> him from miſery: and yet for all this, if you conſider man in this life onlie, whether you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the manifold diſeaſes inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his body, or the infinite vexation of his mind, hee is of all creatures in the world (Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels excepted) the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Now, ſith it ſo fareth with him in this life, it cannot ſtand with the mercy and goodnes of God, but to appoint a better place, and better life, where his goodneſſe and mercy to man, may bee ſhewed. It cannot ſtand with the honour &amp; glorie of God, that that creature ſhold euer periſh, the which hée hath made to behold and conſider his euerlaſting and maruailous workes, &amp; to participate of his euerlaſting goodneſſe, as to this purpoſe he hath made men and Angels. And therefore of all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:28966:109"/> the creatures vnder heauen, hath made the countenance of man to looke vpwards, his eyes rowling fit to turn euery way; his necke flexible to looke round about, that with facility &amp; eaſe, he might contemplate &amp; behold all the works of God, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue him, about him, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. He hath indued him with reaſon, to conſider &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of them; and only vnto man a tongue, to expreſſe the power, wiſdome, and goodneſſe of God, and to glorifie him for the goodneſſe which he imparteth to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Now, if the reaſonable ſoule of man, made to glorifie God ſhould periſh, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt inſtrument of Gods glory ſhould periſh; but it cannot ſtand with the glory of God, that the chiefeſt inſtrument of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:28966:109"/> his glory ſhould periſh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is againſt al reaſon, that the ſoule of man ſhould periſh with the body. It cannot ſtand with naturall reaſon, that the ſoule of man ſhould periſh with the body, becauſe the ſoule of man hath not his beginning from the ſubſtance of the body, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liues of beaſts haue their beginning out of the matter &amp; ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their bodies; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it dyeth with their bodies, becauſe the beginning thereof came from a corruptible cauſe. Their bodies are corruptible, becauſe they are compoſed of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary qualities, as your frend <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confeſſeth: But it is not ſo in the ſoule of man. The ſoule of man is not made out of the matter of his body, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> alſo confeſſeth, but is a diuine ſubſtance, which came
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:28966:110"/> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. And here by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, ſuffer me to ſhew you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> agreeth in this point with the Scripture: When as God made the beaſts, ſowles, and créeping things, hee ſaid, <hi>Let the earth bring forth euery li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thing according to his kinde:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ. 1.24.25.</note> and in the words following, it is ſaid, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d made the beaſts of the earth.</hi> But when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to make man, he ſpeaketh after another manner: ſaying, <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt ſpeaking to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weaknes of our capacitie: ſignifieth, that man is of that excellencie, that that God, euen the Trinitie, tooke conſultation in making man. <hi>Let vs make man.</hi> When hee made other creatures, hee ſaith only, let this or that bee, and it was done: but when he commeth to make ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:28966:110"/> to what dignity hee orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him, and whereunto hée maketh him, euen like vnto himſelfe. The ſoule of man (which is properly man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſpeech in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.7. 1. Cor. 15.45.</note> 
                  <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made a liuing ſoule</hi>) is the very image of God. As God is infinite, and knoweth all things; ſo is the ſoule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made infinite, to receaue all knowledge. He neuer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo much, but is capable to know more. Secondly, as the will of God is infinite; ſo is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will of man made infinite, not tyed to will this or that, but whatſoeuer it pleaſeth, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſtrayned to will any thing. Thirdly, as God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good; ſo is the ſoule of man capable of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: nay it neuer ceaſeth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it attayneth it. Make man
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:28966:111"/> a King, he is not ſatisfied, but his deſire enlargeth it ſelfe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Make him a Monarke, he is not contented, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more. Make him Lord of all the world, yet is he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: The reaſon hereof is, becauſe theſe thinges may bée bettered. So that as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the elements are, they neuer ceaſe vntill they come to the place of their proper eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The fire neuer ceaſeth tending vpward, vntill it be aboue the element of the aire; nor the aire, vntil it be aboue the water; nor the water euer ceaſeth to fall downward, vntill it come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottome of the ſea; nor any part of the earth, vntill it come vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> center of the earth, if it were not hindred. So the ſoule of man neuer ceaſeth vntill it come vnto God himſelfe, from
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:28966:111"/> whome it came. No finite goodneſſe can ſatisfie it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that wherein there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which only is God himſelf. Fourthly, as God is eternal, ſo the naturall deſire of the ſoule is, to be eternall in happineſſe, and to liue euerlaſtingly. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as God ruleth al the world, and euery creature therein, and giueth life vnto them and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo the ſoule of man giueth life vnto all the body of man, and motions vnto euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, and ruleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body according to his wil: nay further, man (according to that authority which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him) hath authority ouer all the beaſts of the field, fowles of the ayre, fiſhes of the ſea, and all earthly creatures to rule &amp; vſe them at his pleaſure, as a pettie God on earth. Sixtly, as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:28966:112"/> God ruleth all the world, yet can he not be ſéene, nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended what he is: ſo the ſoule ruleth the whole body; yet can it not be ſéene, nor rightly by humane reaſon be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what it is. Seauenthly, as God is in the world, but is not contayned in any part of the world; ſo the ſoule of man is in the body of man: but is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in any part of the body, as your <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, but by his reaſonable and ſpiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties diſcourſeth of things far diſtant from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, he is with a triſe diſcourſing of matters in forraigne countries, and in the twinckling of an eye at home againe. He is conſidering on things on earth, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he mounteth vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; he is not wearied, or payned with the greatneſſe of the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:28966:112"/> There he diſcourſeth on ſpirituall inuiſible and diuine matters, of the maieſty of God, of his infinite wiſdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, mercy, and iuſtice: of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and eternall happines of the Angels: all theſe &amp; the like operations, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule vſeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ayde of the body. Now in all things created, there are two things to be conſidered the eſſence of the things and their operations. There can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of any thing whereof there is no eſſence: no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there can be any accident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſubiect. But you ſée e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the ſoule h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Well, then I will ſhewe you diuers playne and euident vntruths. God ſayd to <hi>Adam,</hi> when he placed him in <hi>Paradiſe, in that day that thou eateſt of the tree of knowledge of good and euil,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:28966:114"/> thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> and in the next chapter following, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaith, that hee did eate of the forbidden fruite, and dyed not, and ſaith further in the 5. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that <hi>Adam liued nine hundred and thirtie yeares.</hi> If he dyed not, that day wherein hee did eate of the forbidden fruite. But liued many yeares afterward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat children. Then that is not true, that he ſhould dye the ſame daye, that hee ſhould eate of the forbidden fruite. If he dyed that day that he did eate of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruite: Then the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, that he liued ſo long, and begat children, then tell me which of theſe two are falſe. The ſecond vntruth I take out of the 4. chap. of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> When <hi>Caine</hi> had ſlaine his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> God ſaith vnto him for his puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>a vagabond and a runnagate ſhalt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:28966:114"/> thou be in the earth.</hi> And yet in the ſame chapter it is ſayd, that Kain <hi>dwelt in the Eaſt ſide of Eden, and builded a Citie.</hi> If <hi>Caine</hi> were ahouſhoulder, and builded a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. How was hee a vagabound and a runnagate, both theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true: Tell me which of them is falſe? A third vntruth I gather out of the whole ſcripture which is this, large promiſes of health, wealth, and proſperitie, vnto thoſe that keepe the law of God.

Now that theſe are not vntruthes which you haue alleadged, I will by the grace of God make moſt manifeſt. The firſt, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſéemeth vnto you to be vntrue, is, in that God ſaid vnto <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that he ſhould die the ſame day that he ſhould eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:28966:117"/> fruit, but the Scripture teſtifieth, that he died not the day that he did eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, but liued nine hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirtie yeares after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. In theſe words there is no contradiction or falſhood, as you imagine: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which, that you may the better vnderſtand, you muſt know, that there are thrée ſorts of liues, and thrée ſorts of deathes: thrée ſorts of liues, as firſt, the corporal life which is the coniunction of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, in which vnion, the ſoule giueth all vegitable &amp; ſenſible faculties vnto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his intellectuall, and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable faculties, hee exerciſeth without the body. Secondly, the ſpirituall life, whereby wée liue vnto God, when as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the temples of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, liue a ſanctified life
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:28966:118"/> vnto the honour of God. A third kind of life is that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, which after this life, the Saints of God liue in the preſence of God in fulneſſe of ioy and happineſſe. Likewiſe, there are three ſorts of deathes; a corporall death, when as the ſoule departeth from the body, leauing neither ſence, nor moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the body. Secondly, there is a ſpirituall death in this life, when as the ſpirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from vs, or is not reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in vs, without whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ayde, we cannot but fall into all kind of wickednes: neither can we haue any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of godlineſſe, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth a ſpirituall life. A third kind of death, is after this life, when as a man is caſt into hell body and ſoule, there euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly to endure torments vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:28966:118"/> Now true it is, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> died not the firſt kinde of death, which is the ſeperation of the body and ſoule, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame day he did eate of the forbidden fruit, as it was not meant hée ſhould: but he died the ſecond kind of death, which is a reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of Gods fauour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the happie life of man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth; and that God denounced vnto <hi>Adam</hi> the ſecond kind of death, and not the firſt. S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> prooueth out of the words of the text, God ſaith not to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> what day thou eateſt of the trée of knowledge of good &amp; euill thou ſhalt die. (ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi>) but thou ſhalt die the death; by ſaying thou ſhalt die the death, hee importeth more, then if hee had ſaid, thou ſhalt die. For in ſaying, thou ſhalt die <hi>The death,</hi> he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:28966:119"/> that he ſhould die y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of all deathes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt death of all others, euen reiected out of the fauour of God: and that he died this kind of death the ſame day he taſted of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit. I néede not ſtand to prooue, ſith the thing is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: ſo that there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Scripture in this point, but the fault is in your miſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruing it: he died y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame day he taſted of the forbidden fruit, the ſecond death; and the ſame day alſo, was his bodie made ſubiect to death, which before by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauour of God was immortall: and this mortality of the body, was the conſequent of the ſecond death. To liue, is to enioy thoſe things which in themſelues are good &amp; pleaſant. <hi>Ariſt. Eth. li. 9. c. 9.</hi> But <hi>Adam</hi> immediatly after his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:28966:119"/> loſt thoſe things which in themſelues were good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: therefore he died imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his tranſgreſſion: Which poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> fitly agréeth with our commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpéech. When wée ſée a man heauie and dumpiſh without any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, we ſay, that hee hath no life in him: and of men in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery we ſay, ſuch a life is no life. Hée dyed therefore the ſame daye, though hee liued in the body many years after. If you like not <hi>Ambroſes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, conſider what the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Adam</hi> neuer died either in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or ſoule; yet you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not iuſtly ſay, that there is any falſhood in thoſe words of the Scripture, which you haue alleadged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the puniſhment of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> for theſe words. <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death, the ſame day wherein thou ſhalt eate the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit:</hi> are not a propheſie what ſhould come to paſſe; but a commination annexed to a precept, to deterre <hi>Adam</hi> from breaking the commandement. Now you knowe that hee, who hath authoritie to make a law, and appoint punniſhments for the breakers thereof: reſerueth alwaies a power vnto himſelf, to mitigate thoſe punniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which it pleſed him to appoint for the breakers of his law: in mittigating whereof, he offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neither the law, nor equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:28966:120"/> The primary &amp; principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of good Princes, in appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting gréeuous puniſhments for offenders of their lawes, is eſpeciallye to deferre and feare their ſubiects fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tranſgreſſing their comandements.

But ſée how <hi>Sathan</hi> ruleth your maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart and tongue, if God ſhould in rigor without mercie
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:28966:121"/> haue vtterlye deſtroyed <hi>Adam</hi> preſently vpon his offence, both body and ſoule. Then would your clamorous mouth haue béene open, to declaime againſt the rigor of Gods iudgements: but now becauſe he vſeth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in his iudgements, there is no truth in his woordes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he treatneth ſeuerely, but dealeth mercifully, refrayne your blaſphemous tongue, leaſt you taſt of his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy. Concerning your ſecond contradiction (as you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine) that <hi>Kain</hi> was a houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dweller, and built and liued in a Citie, and therefore that was not true which God ſaid ſhold happen vnto him, that he ſhold be a runnagate, and a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. Firſt, the word in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall which is tranſlated a ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate; doth as well ſignifie an
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:28966:121"/> vnconſtant and variable min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, or a man of a troubled &amp; fearefull mind, alwaies miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting and expecting ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to happen vnto him, and that <hi>Kaine</hi> was ſuch a one, the verie building of his Citie doth argue. For before this ſentence of God, againſt the hainous ſinne of <hi>Kaine, Kaine,</hi> nor any elſe euer fortified themſelues with walles or Cities, which was an argument, that they neuer feared inuaſion of men or beaſts. Secondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Kaine</hi> built a Citie and dwelt in it, is a weake argument, that hee was no vagbo and, for although <hi>Moſes</hi> preſently after the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God againſt <hi>Kaine,</hi> Sheweth where he built a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and dwell: yet he ſetteth not down when he built this City. <hi>Moſes</hi> briefly ſetteth downe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:28966:122"/> that, which was done after many yeares, it was vſual the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that men liued Eight or Nine hundred yeares. Now it may be that <hi>Kain</hi> was a vagabound for the ſpace of Fiue Hundred yeares, and after builded this Citie, and this is not my méere coniecture, but <hi>Ioſephus</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that <hi>Kaine</hi> wandred into many countries, before he built this Citie. Thirdlye, theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt be a vagabond,</hi> is a iudicial ſentence: in which ſentences, alwaies what ſhall be done vnto the offender is not ſet downe, neceſſarilye to bee executed: but what his offence deſerueth.

I beléeue the Scripture,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:28966:123"/> yet am I not bound to beléeue that there were in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world but fiue or ſixe perſons when <hi>Kaine</hi> built his Citie: for the Scripture ſaith not ſo, neither in any probability was it ſo. The Scripture indéede men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth no more, but it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not thereon, that then there were no more. <hi>Moſes</hi> onlie briefely nameth thoſe of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall note; but that there were then many more, it is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> probable. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> recordeth that <hi>Kayne</hi> built this Citie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his latter dayes, as it ſhould ſéeme by the vſuall time that men then liued, when hée was about ſome ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or eight hundred yeares of age. Now, in ſeauen or eight hundred yeares, <hi>Kaynes</hi> children and his childrens children might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well grow to a very great
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:28966:123"/> number, ſufficient to inhabit a Citie. Therefore if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the matter dulie, you may know, that it cannot ſéeme that <hi>Kayne</hi> ſhould not build a Citie, for want of people to inhabit it, as you without probability ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now, concerning your third vntruth, which you wold gather out of the Scripture, in that, God promiſeth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bleſſings ſpirituall, and temporall, to thoſe that kéepe his commandements: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewiſe, all manner of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments againſt thoſe that breake his lawes: and yet the Scripture teſtifieth, that they which were moſt godly, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt affliction, and they which were moſt wicked, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially proſpered and enioyed greateſt happineſſe here on earth, as alſo daylie experience
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:28966:124"/> teacheth the ſame. For anſwer whereof, you are to conſider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the promiſes of temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are promiſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they kéepe the law; but none euer yet kept the lawe. Therefore, no man can in right chalenge them to be performed vnto them. Secondly, you are to conſider, that when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord promiſed the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> wealth, health, and worldlie proſperity, the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor health, wealth, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is properly and principally to be vnderſtoode and meant; but figuratiuely vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of theſe earthly bleſſings, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſſings are principally vnderſtood. The reaſon why God vſeth the names of theſe earthly bleſſings, to expreſſe theſe ſpirituall bleſſings vnto men, which he principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:28966:124"/> vnto them, is, becauſe that as theſe ſpiritual bleſſings excéede the capacitie of mortall men: ſo there are no ſufficient words ſufficiently ta expreſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellency of them. Therfore God vſeth the names of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſings beſt knowne vnto men, to ſignifie vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thoſe bleſſings, which as yet their weakneſſe cannot conceaue of. Now, that theſe earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed to the obſeruers of the law, are not principally ment, but ſpirituall bleſſings vnder their names, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints of God, expected ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſſings vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> names of theſe bleſſings.

               <p>True it is, that God promiſeth rewards to thoſe who kéep his laws, &amp; denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth puniſhments againſt thoſe who breake his law.

               <p>Sée how partiall you are in iudgement, you iuſtifie your ſelfe in doing that, which in God you account iniuſtice &amp; cruelty. You thinke you haue reaſon for your doing, yet you
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:28966:134"/> carp at the maieſty of God. Yea though he doth not as you doe, deſtroy the young ſnakes which neuer did harme, God doth not puniſh any that are harmeleſſe, but only puniſh the wicked ſonnes of wicked pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. For it is not ſaid as you repeate the words, that God will viſit the ſinnes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vpon the third or fourth generation, whether guilty, or guiltleſſe; but it is added, <hi>on them that hate him.</hi> The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which hate God, are not guiltleſſe. Neither are you to vnderſtand vnder the name of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, any kind of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. For no ſinner is damned for the ſinne of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for this puniſhment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal damnation, no man ſhal ſuffer for any mans fault, but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:28966:134"/> his owne: <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall die.</hi> Furthermore, God doth not puniſh with temporall puniſhments the wicked ſons of wicked parents, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhments for the ſinnes of their Fathers, then their owne ſinnes doe iuſtly deſerue. But in this reſpect God is ſaid to puniſh the wicked ſonnes of wicked parents vnto the third and fourth generation, becauſe God apointeth vnto euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, citie, and familie, a time to continue, before he powreth out his wrath vpon them, vntil they haue filled vp that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſinnes, and growne ſo obſtinate in ſinne as God hath appointed, then no longer to ſuffer them. So that if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a wicked ſonne had not ſinned, God would longer haue deferred the puniſhment of his
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:28966:135"/> wicked ſonne. The way for parents to haue their poſterity to continue long and proſper, is to abſtaine from ſinne: for in ſinning, they haſten the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of their poſterity. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, in this puniſhing of the ſinnes of the Fathers vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children, vnto the third and fourth generation; not only the ſonne, but alſo the Father is puniſhed too. When God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth the ſonne, the father is grieued oftentimes more then the ſonne, to ſée his ſonne in trouble, vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or tormented with diſeaſes, or ſuffer loſſe of goods, and liue in miſery. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof, wee haue both in prophane, and diuine hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: <hi>Dauid</hi> wiſhed that hee had died for his rebellious ſon <hi>Abſolon.</hi> And <hi>Appian</hi> in his hiſtory of the ciuill warres of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:28966:135"/> the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in the fearefull times of proſcription ſheweth, what great care parents had towards their children, ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their owne liues to ſaue their ſonnes. God in puniſhing the ſinnes of the Fathers vpon the children; not only hereby calleth the ſonnes to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; but alſo the Fathers: and this is the reaſon, that God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the ſinnes of the Fathers vpon the children, no further then vnto the fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe vſually, no father liueth longer then that he may ſée any of his poſterity, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fourth generation. After this fourth generation, no affliction laid on his poſterite, can bring him to repentance. For repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cannot be but in this life. Seing therefore, that ſuch are the ardent affections euen of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:28966:136"/> wicked parents towards their children, that they as much, yea oftentimes more deſire to ſee their children to liue in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then themſelues, (God knowing their inordinate loue, that they loue their children more then God himſelfe.) Hée therefore threatneth wicked parents y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will puniſh their children for their ſinne: that if for loue or feare of him, they will not abſtaine from ſinne, yet they might feare to offend God for loue of their children; and the more to incite fathers vnto godlineſſe, he doth promiſe good fathers, (that is, ſuch as vnfaynedly doe their endeuour to liue according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements) that he wil bleſſe their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a thowſand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, in them that feare him. This being ſo, you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:28966:136"/> accuſe God of iniuſtice in puniſhing the ſinnes of the Fathers vpon their children: ſith theſe temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe not excéede the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of their owne proper ſins. Nay, if you well conſider this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner which God vſeth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the ſinnes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vpon the childred, you ſhal find that God dealeth moſt mercifully herein. For firſt, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God prolongeth his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he giueth time &amp; ſpace to the father to repent, which if he doe, neither father, nor ſonne ſuffereth puniſhment. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this kind of puniſhing, God calleth both father &amp; ſonne to repentance: but eſpecially the father, in a more fit time to repentance, then if hee ſhould preſently lay ſome temporall puniſhment on him, as ſoone
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:28966:137"/> as he offendeth: for more head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong are men in their youth to take their pleaſure in ſinne, then in their olde age; they will fulfill their luſts then, though they ſmart for it. But in older yeares, their affections are not ſo vehement; then are they more conſiderate in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fitter to receaue corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If God then call them to repentance, they will not be ſo vnrulie. Wherefore moſt vniuſtly you terme this kind of puniſhing, abſurd and vniuſt dealing. Now, concerning your ſecond abſurdity, which you would gather out of the Scripture, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs, that none can be ſaued, except they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in Chriſt: Of whome, many before the lawe giuen to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the time of the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:28966:137"/> old law, and ſince the time of the Goſpell neuer heard of; and that before the time of the Goſpell, God choſe only the nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> reiecting all other people, and ſince on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beléeuers: and out of this, you conclude, God to bée cruell and vniuſt, to create me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and then condemn them for not obſeruing the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of which they neuer hard, and for not beléeuing in him, of whom they neuer hard. For anſwere hereof, you muſt knowe, that God ſaueth men after two ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies, ordinarily, and extraordinarily. Now, when as the Scripture teacheth vs, that none can bée ſaued except they beléeue in Chriſt, it is to be vnderſtood only of thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: vnto whom y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ordinary means of ſaluation haue béene reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:28966:138"/> except the fault be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that theſe meanes were not known vnto them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Children, who are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of theſe ordinary means, are ſaued without this actuall faith in Chriſt. Neither ſhall any being of yeares and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euer be condemned for not beléeuing expreſlye in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ot Chriſt, if he neuer heard of Chriſt. If his ignorance be ſuch, as by his diligence he cold not come to the knowledge of Chriſt.

Wherefore moſt falſe is that which you ſaye, that God choſe onely the nation of the Iewes, and reiected all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple elſe. I confeſſe that the Iews held this for a truth, that onely the circumciſed could be ſaued, &amp; all other damned,<note place="margin">Act. 10.34 35.</note> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Peter</hi> vntil he was better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, But it was onely a tradition of their elders, their law taught them not this, they were commanded not to ioyne league or familiaritie with the people of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but deſtroye them. But after all the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi> were deſtroyed, they thought it vnlawfull to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dealing with the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and héerein they erred. True it is, that God cheſe of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:28966:140"/> all the nations in the world, onely the Iewes, but to what? not to ſaluation, for many of the Gentiles were elected to this, aſwell as the Iewes: but to bee Preiſts and inſtructers to the world, to bée examples and guides to worſhippe God, to all people. For as <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes, amongſt the Iewes, were ſeparated from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tribes, to bée holy vnto the Lord, and to be preiſts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors to their brethren: So the whole nation of the Iewes were ſeparated from all other nations, to bée prieſts vnto all nations, and to be, as the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſaith of them,<note place="margin">Rom 2.17 18.19.</note>

Diuines diſtinguiſh of ignorance, One kind of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they call <hi>vinſibilis,</hi> which by diligence may bee auoided. The other <hi>inuinſibilis,</hi> which by no diligence can bee auoyded. The former kind alſo is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts one more pardonable then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. The ignorance, which commeth by the imheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:28966:151"/> of nature, which is the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of thoſe, whome wée co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly call Innocents, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignorance w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> commeth by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the difficulty of the things to be vnderſtoode, or by the ſmall means to attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things to be known, is moſt pardonable, yet ſins they are, els God wold not haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſacrifices for them. But affected ignorance voluntarily vſed, is moſt dangerous: and he w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> vſeth it, is no leſſe culpable of his own damnation, then he which voluntarilye abſtayneth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foode &amp; pineth himſelfe to death, is guilty of his own deth. For as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one is appointed as a means to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other is appoynted as a means to obtaine life euerlaſting. And as we are to labour for the one, ſo alſo for the other, otherwiſe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:28966:151"/> are we guiltie of our owne deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction. As for the other kind of ignorance, which Diuines call <hi>inuinſibilis,</hi> ſuch as by no meanes can be auoided, is not taken for a ſinne, but a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of ſin (as I haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.) So that the heathen who neuer by any means could heare of Chriſt, offend not, in not beléeuing in Chriſt expreſly. Yet in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they naturally knowe that there is a God, and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that doe well: By conſequent they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his prouidence, and by conſequence hereof, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that God hath a meanes to ſaue their ſoules, though the meanes thereof be vnknowne to them.

               <p>Whereas you ſay, that by interpretations I may make any thing true: it is not ſo. No interpretations can make that which is indéed true to bee falſe, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is falſe, true. Words cannot alter the natures of things, and make truth, falſhood; or falſhood, truth. Whereas in ſcorne you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, whether God doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to make men erre, becauſe manye thinges in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are hard to be vnderſtoode. You are to knowe, that God hath appointed a generall daye of iudgement, wherin the déeds of all men ſhall bée iudged, in the preſence of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And therfore before hand
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:28966:155"/> hath ſo tempered things, that all men in their déeds might ſhew what they are. When the Lord gaue the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> vnto the children of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> he might haue deſtroyed all the <hi>Cananites,</hi> when hee brought the Iſraelites firſt into the land.<note place="margin">Iudg. 3.</note> But hee did not, that by thoſe <hi>Cananites</hi> which were left aliue in the Land,<note place="margin">Deut. 15.</note> the hearts of the Iſraelites might be manifeſted: To trye whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would be drawen to Idolatrye: To trye whether they would enter into league and familiarity or no with the <hi>Cananites,</hi> the which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely forbidden them. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, God could haue made the ſcripture in all places ſo eaſie, that it ſhould nor néede anye interpreter. But he hath not, to trie the hearts of men. Theſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:28966:155"/> hard places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture, they who are of an humble ſpirit, ſéeke to vnderſtand with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie &amp; reuerence.

All they therfore, who are deſirous to obay his will, will reade his word, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might know what his will is, reuealed in his woord, that they may doe it, and obſerue it. If they méete with any difficult place to bée vnderſtood, they will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to cenſure it, or as you, &amp; the like, draw it to an abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their capacitie.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:28966:156"/> reſerued vnto their due time, in which God hath appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vnderſtood, as many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies both in the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and the new.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.9.</note> The vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding whereof is not known before the things propheſied of are performed. That men comparing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euents of thinges with the former Propheſies, might ſée that things come not to paſſe by chance, ſince ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents were foretold, that they ſhould come to paſſe manye yeares before they fell out. Therefore they make vſe of thoſe things which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. As for thoſe thinges w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paſſe their vnderſtanding, they reuerence, and not cenſure them. Now, whereas you condemne the ſcripture of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt falſhood, becauſe you haue not obtayned by you prayers,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:28966:156"/> whatſoeuer you haue aſked; becauſe it is ſaid in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, aſke what you will belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and yee ſhall obtaine it. The promiſe is moſt true, but by you much miſtaken. For this promiſe is made onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true beléeuers. Now, many there are who vaynelye perſwade themſelues, that they are true beléeuers, who indéed are not. Who pray after their ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, but not as they ſhould, and they obtaine not. And no maruaile, for the promiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not vnto ſuch men. Wherfore to ſhew your errour in conſtruing theſe promiſes; You are to conſider many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances requiſite to obtain that which you pray for. The firſt and principall is, that that which you pray for, you ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without hipocriſie, intend to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:28966:157"/> vſe vnto the glory of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, many things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the perſon which pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Many thinges, in the things prayed for, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whome wée pray for, and in reſpect of God, to whom we pray. In the perſon which prayeth, firſt, he muſt be in charitte, hee muſt forgiue all men, elſe he obtaineth not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you forgiue men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.15.</note> my father which is in Heauen will not forgiue you your treſpaſſes.<note place="margin">Ia. 1.6.7.</note> He muſt pray in faith not doubting, not that hee ſhall receaue euerye thing without exception whatſoeuer he aſketh (for this cannot ſtand with a true faith.) But that God is able and will performe any thing which wee aſke of him, ſo farre foorth, as thoſe things we aſke ſhalbe behooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:28966:157"/> for vs and fit for our calling and place wherein God hath appointed vs to liue in. Again, if we looke that God ſhold har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto our prayers, we may not bee ſtained with groſſe and hainous ſinnes.<note place="margin">Eſay. 1.15.</note> For the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the wicked are an abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination vnto the Lord. Yea their prayers are tourned vnto ſinne. Hee muſt lift vp pure hands vnto the Lord;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> Hee muſt not be cruelly minded, or hard harted. For it is ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which ſhutteth his eare at the crie of the poore, he ſhall crye and not be heard.<note place="margin">Prou. 21.</note> He muſt not be of an obſtinat and ſtubborne mind, but ready and willing to obay the commaundements of the Lord. For it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Pro. 28.9.</note> hée that tourneth his eare from hearing the law, euen his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall be abhominable. But
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:28966:158"/> the prayer of the iuſt auaileth much.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> Iuſt they are eſtéemed, who haue a ſerious endeauour without hipocriſie, to followe and obay the commandements of God; though they fall Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times, yea many times a day. Theſe and the like are required in the perſons which may obtayne that which they aſke for. So likewiſe, many things are to be conſidered in the things we pray for. The things for which we pray to God, are in generall of twoo ſorts, ether they are good things which we deſire to obtaine; Or elſe they are euill things from which we deſire to be fréed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Again, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which are good, are of two ſorts. Either they are ſimply good, ſuch as cannot be abuſed; As faith, hope, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, forgiueneſſe of ſins, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:28966:158"/> life: Or els they are in part good, ſuch as may be well vſed, or abuſed vnto ill purpoſes. Of this kind are the naturall gifts of the body and mind, as the ſtrength of the body comelines, and beautifulnes, ſharpeneſſe, and quicknes of wit, learning, eloquence. Of this kind alſo are they, which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call <hi>bona fortuna,</hi> as riches honour, &amp; promotion, and ſuch like. The former kind of good things which are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, we may abſolutely without exception praye vnto God for, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would beſtow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on vs. The latter kind of good things, which are ſuch which maye bee vſed vnto ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, we may not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye pray for without exception. But ſo farre forth as they may
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:28966:159"/> be meanes and furtherances towards the obtayning of the former kind of good things: ſo that if any man prayeth for thefe latter kind of good things without exception, (as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the obtayning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may ſtand with the glory of God, his prouidence whereby before the foundations of the world, hee hath appointed vnto euery man ſuch graces as are fit for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſons of ſuch eſtate, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath appointed them to liue.) Hee prayeth not as hee ought to pray, neither hath hee which prayeth thus without exception for theſe kindes of good things, any promiſe in all the Scripture, that he ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne them. As for the former ſort of good things, whoſoeuer prayeth for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a true faith, hath euen
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:28966:159"/> at the time of his faithful pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as much as will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him, to bring him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. For whome God once loueth, he loueth for euer; and on whome once he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe kinde of graces, (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Diuines call <hi>gratum facientes</hi>) hee alwaies continueth them vntill they enter into the ioyes of heauen. Now, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are good, are of two ſorts, for which we muſt pray for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a different manner: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the things which are euil, (from which wee deſire to bee fréed from) are of two ſorts. And likewiſe we muſt make a difference of them in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The things which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, are either abſolutely euill, or euill in part: Abſolutely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, are all manner of ſinnes; euils in part, are al ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:28966:160"/> of puniſhments; as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of Countries, Cities, diſeaſes, loſſe of goods &amp; ſuch like, It is our dutie to pray vnto God, that hee would free vs from ſinne, and this we may pray for without exception. As for the other ſort of euils, which are tearmed <hi>mala poenae,</hi> euils of puniſhment; we may not pray for to be deliuered from them but with exception, becauſe theſe euils are great meanes, to kéepe vs in true humility, in a true acknowledgement of our owne weakenſſe and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to kéepe vs in continuall feare and worſhippe of God. They cauſe vs to pray vnto God hartily for his ayde, and in a word, they are very great meanes to bring vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.<note place="margin">2.

                     </gap>.</note> This was the cauſe that when as <hi>Paul</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:28966:160"/> vnto God, that that meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan which was ſent vnto him to buffet him, (leaſt he ſhould be high minded, or be exalted aboue meaſure,) he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned not his petition, for it was not conuenient for him, but receaued this anſwere of God, that his grace was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him, and that his power is made perfect through weakneſſe. Laſtly, in reſpect of God, we are to conſider his prouidence, wee are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we ſhould obtayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which he hath in his prouidence diſpoſed of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. An obedient ſonne may pray for his father lying ſicke, that God would prolong his dayes; but oftentimes hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth not his good deſire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God in his prouidence hath determined y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his father
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:28966:161"/> ſhould the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> end his dayes. Theſe and the like conditions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily being required in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who pray, and the things prayed for, it is no meruaile, though you prayed often, and yet obtayned not,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.3.</note> becauſe you prayed for thoſe things, which you would ſpend on your luſts, you reſpecting nothing Gods glory in thoſe things you pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, but your owne aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nay rather, your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was a murmuring againſt God, and not a prayer. For you were diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with your meane eſtate, and (to vſe your owne wordes) if God would not aduance you, you would prouide for your ſelfe. Al men naturally deſire to be in high eſtate, and if euery one of vs might by prayer obtaine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we liſt, we would be all
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:28966:161"/> at the leaſt Kings. But this cannot ſtand with the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, nor with the generall good of all mankind, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is for a common wealth, that there ſhould bee different degrees &amp; ſtates of men, as it is for mans body to haue diuers members of diuers functions. If all the members ſhould be the head, where ſhould bée tha ſtomacke to nouriſh the head? If all ſhould be the ſtomacke, where ſhould the head and the hands be, to prouide meate for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomacke? The Ploughma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as neceſſary for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common wealth, as the noble Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; the one cannot be without the other.

(as you ſhall finde the moſt part of men to bee faultie herein, if you dulie examine their liues) better it were a great deale, that the moſt part of men ſhould not pray at all vnto God. For their
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:28966:162"/> prayers are an abhomination vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and doe diſpleaſe him. What is this elſe, but to diſſwade men from praying when they haue offended?</hi>

                  <hi>I will tell you why, (ſith I haue begunne to open my ſecrets vpon promiſes of your fidelity and ſecreſie.) When I departed from <hi>Oxford,</hi> I went to teach a young Gentleman in the Countrie, whoſe Father was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry olde: with whome I practiſed the counſaile of <hi>Tyreſias,</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hor. ſatyr. <hi>5.</hi> lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and of <hi>Dauus</hi> ſo cunningly, that I quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſinuated my ſelfe into great fauour with the olde man, in ſo much, that he thought no man was ſo fit to traine vp his young ſonne, as my ſelfe. The which when I perceaued, I pretended that I intended not to ſtay long with him, but prouide ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall liuing, (but I meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe.) For that would be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall ſtay vnto me: in ſtaying with him, was but a point of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For when his ſonne ſhould come to yeares, then ſhould I
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:28966:164"/> be caſt off, to ſhift for my ſelfe. When the olde Gentleman ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that I watched opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e to keepe mee was doubled. Many offers he made me, but (to be ſhort) at length we agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon this; that I ſhould haue my life in a certaine Farme, after the eſtate of one man, (who then had intereſt in it) ſhold be voide. After this concluſion, my olde Maſter ſhortly dyed. He being dead, I got the counterpane of the title wherby this Farmer held his Farme. The which I ſhewed to a very cunning Lawyer, deſiring him, to finde ſome defect in it, if he could. The which when he read it ouer, he tolde me, that the title indeede was very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; notwithſtanding, hee could picke certaine quarrels againſt it, and make a prettie ſhew that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:28966:164"/> it was not good. I requeſted him to doe his beſt endeuour in the matter, and I would fee him wel. I was the bolder to attempt this, becauſe then there were two cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hungry fellowes, who were in ſome diſtreſſe, by reaſon they feared my young Maſter would not retayne them in his ſeruice as his Father did: Theſe men I knew were men of large conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and therefore the fitter for my purpoſe. Theſe men I brought into fauour with my young Maſter, becauſe I knewe that theſe fellowes would ſweare any thing for my ſake. To omit many circumſtances, I put the Farmer in ſute for his liuing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that his title was not good. Before the matter came to pleading, my Lawyer aduiſed me in my eare many thinges, which accordingly I performed.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:28966:165"/> And this I will tell you in your eare, by a little fee, and mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of friends, I ſecretly got the Farmers Lawyer more my frend then his Clyents; yet he pleaded very eagerly, and vſed manye words, but not directly to the point, as I know he could, and would haue done, had not I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe before ſeaſoned him. So that by this meanes, and the fauourable oathes of my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſeruingmen, the Farmers title ſeemed not good. The Iudge did his duty, he could not but iudge <hi>ſecundum allegata, &amp; probata:</hi> By this meanes I got my Farme. But when I came to turne out the Farmer, his wife &amp; children, they with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours made ſuch an outcrie on me, with vilde tearmes, that it ſomewhat amazed me. I knew before I put the Farmer in ſute,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:28966:165"/> that I ſhould doe him wrong in putting him from his Farme; but it then neuer mooued my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thinke on it. But when I had done it, then as an vnhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meate after a man hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, it often riſeth in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and vpbraydeth it: ſo when I had done this fact, often the remembrance of it did yrke me, eſpecially as oft as I came in ſight of the Farmer, or any of his. So that I often then deſired God (for then I was in a ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring opinion, ſometimes doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whether there was a God or no, and ſometimes fearing, leaſt there ſhould be a God that wold puniſh me) hartily to forgiue me my fault, and diuers times then by fits hartily repented. Now ſit, ſay that I did in this fact offend God and man, I am now guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. For in reſpect of God, I am
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:28966:166"/> free from this ſin, becauſe I haue repented it, and at what time ſoeuer a ſinner repenteth, God forgiueth him his ſinne. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of men, I offend not in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of the Farme. For the Iudge rightly according to the forme of law, &amp; proofes brought before him, pronounced ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on my ſide. And therfore I iuſtly poſſeſſe it, according to law. This being ſo, I am not bound either by lawe or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to make reſtitution, ſith in poſſeſſing it, I offend now, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor man.</hi>

Why, doe you thinke that any kinde of repentance is accepted of God, but a true repentance? or that we may poſſeſſe any thing with a good conſcience gotten by the abuſe of lawe, as you haue gotten your Farme? it is ſaid, that <hi>Iudas</hi> repented, yet he was reiected of God.

This ſignified our Sauiour Chriſt in that Parable of the Figtrée,<note place="margin">Luc. 13.6.</note> which only cumbred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground in the vineyard, and brought foorth no fruit: and therefore ſhould haue béene preſently caſt out, but that the dreſſer of the vineyard obtayned thrée years ſpace, to try, whether by manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, it might be brought to bring foorth good fruit; if not in that ſpace, it was to bée caſt

When <hi>Eſaw</hi> had for a ſmall portion of meate ſold his birthbright, afterwards he could not inherite, but was reiected, and though hee ſought it with teares,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.17.</note> yet hee founde no place for his repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; a bare griefe, though it be from the bottome of the heart,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.8.9.10.</note> is not a ſufficient repentance; but there muſt be alſo an amendment of life.<note place="margin">Luc. 13.3.</note> And this is the cauſe why <hi>Daniell</hi> exhorted <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (who by cruelty and oppreſſion, had ſpoyled many of the poore) to breake off his ſinnes by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.24.</note> and by mercy and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality to the poore, that by that meanes, hee might make reſtitution of that hee had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully gotten. And if you will ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patterne of a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, conſider the example of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who before his

But when he repented, then to redéeme his faults committed againſt men, he gaue halfe his goods to the poore, and if hée had taken any thing from any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by forged cauillation, he would reſtore him foure-folde.<note place="margin">Luc. 19.8.</note> For albeit we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not by this means ſatisfie for our ſinnes before God, yet by reſtitution of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull gotten goods we may, and ought to ſatisfie men.

                  <hi>Becauſe I haue learned this rule, that no affirmatiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept bindeth any man alwaies to performe it. <hi>Obligat ſemper ſed non ad ſemper.</hi> Whereas nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precepts bind vs alwaies <hi>ad ſemper.</hi> As for example. I am commanded to giue almes to the poore, to pray alwaies; yet am I not continually bound to be giuing. For it is impoſſible for any man to haue ſo much goods, as that he may be alwaies giuing. Againe, I ſinne not, if I be not alwaies praying. For God aloweth mee the night to ſleepe, and take my reſt; he alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me a time to take my foode, and be merry, and a time to doe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:28966:171"/> my wordly buſineſſe.

Now ſir, that I muſt make reſtitution, or elſe my repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is no true repentance, nor wil be accepted of; you bring for profe of it, only affirmatiue precepts out of the Scripture: on which, your Councell of <hi>Turone,</hi> your Fathers, your new Diuines, both Proteſtants and Papiſts, ground their opinions. The ground of all their opinions being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on an affirmatiue precept, do not neceſſarily conclude that which they intend: which being ſo, I will hold my Farme, I will hold my hold, I poſſeſſe it by lawe. I had rather bee tyed to obſerue all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God beſides, then
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:28966:171"/> this. You muſt pardon mee in this point.</hi>

               <p>It is a ſtrange thing to ſée how ſubtile men are, to bring themſelues to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and what wiles they can inuent, that the word of God ſhal not take hold on their offences. But to anſwere you; It is true indéede, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines haue ſuch a rule, that affirmatiue precepts bind vs alwaies to obſerue them; but not at all times. And that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue preceps doe bind vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and at all times to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them. But it pleaſeth you to remember no more of the rule, then will make for your purpoſe. You will not take notice of that part of the rule, which maketh againſt you. For it is added in the rule of affirmatiue preeps, that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:28966:172"/> albeit affirmatiue precepts doe not bind you to doe at al times that which is commanded, as to pray night and day without ceaſing; or continually to giue almez without intermiſſion: yet doe they neceſſarily binde vs to obſerue them, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, time and place require them to be done; when charity requireth the performance of them. Obſerue you theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the rule, and you ſhal not offend. You haue time and opportunity to reſtore your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful gotten goods, the rule of charity requireth it: Therefore you euen by this rule, ought to haue reſtored it before this time. And becauſe you ſéeme to eſtéeme rules in expounding commandements or precepts; it is a generall rule, that hée which commandeth, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:28966:172"/> that which is of leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, much more comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or forbiddeth that which is of greater importance in the ſame kind. As for example, in the tenth commandement it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours wife, nor his maide, nor his oxe, nor his aſſe, nor any thing that is his.</hi> Surely God who forbiddeth vs to couet theſe things of our neighbour, much more forbiddeth vs in theſe words the vnlawfull poſſeſſion of our neighbours goods: if we may not couet them, much leſſe may we haue them, if we only couet them in our mindes, we only offend God; but if we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully take them, we offend God and man. Thus you ſée, that in poſſeſſing your Farme vnlawfully gotten, you breake both affirmatiue, and negatiue
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:28966:173"/> precepts. For if you may not couet any thing which is your neighbours, much leſſe haue them; then by neceſſary conſequent, you ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it againe.</p>

               <p>Surely the Scripture teacheth mee, that hee which willingly refuſeth the meanes
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:28966:173"/> of ſaluation, ſhall neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſaluation. A true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is a neceſſary means to be reconciled to God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without it, no man can be ſaued: the Scripture is moſt plaine in this point. The Lord ſaith in <hi>Ezechiell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 33.14.15.</note> When I ſay to the wicked thou ſhalt die y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death; if he turne from his ſin, &amp; doe that which is lawfull and right, if hee reſtore the pledge, (marke what here is required, he muſt reſtore the pledge to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore, which was willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him by the owner, and not by wrong taken from him, as you got your Farme) and giue backe that hee had robbed (to got by fraud is a kinde of robbery, and the worſt kinde) and walke in the ſtatutes of life (it is not ſufficient to abſtaine from euill, but he muſt
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:28966:174"/> do good) he ſhal liue and not die. By theſe words the Lord ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, after what manner he will iudge all men, that they who truely and vnfainedly repent, that is, ſatiſfie men for the wrongs done vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as much as in them lieth, and hartily deſire pardon of God for their offence, ſhall be ſaued.

If any man flatter himſelfe, that God will pardon him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee hath not a willing mind, and do not his endeauour to be reconciled to his brother, and ſatisfie him for his wrong done vnto him. He maketh God a lyar, who cannot lye, and he ſhall find, (but too late,) that that which he foreſheweth, he will do, and will indéed performe.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:28966:178"/> But except they haue the ſpirit of regeneration, whereby their perſons are firſt accepted of God, and whereby they firſt loue God; ſuch repentance and faith are not accepted of God.</p>

                  <hi>You confeſſe then, that God can and doth ſaue many without actuall faith, and actuall repentance, that being ſo, it doth not follow, that neceſſarily I am a reprobate, though I dye with the intent neuer to reſtore my Farme againe. And ſurely, if there bee a God, his mercie is greater then his iuſtice, as you all teach. I will relye vpon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if he call mee to iudgement, and not on my repentance and good workes. I hope to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by that extraordinarie way of ſauing whereof you ſpeake, in which neither faith nor repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:28966:178"/> is required. And indeed, I now remember you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that one of the theeues which were crucified with ch iſt, was ſaued after this manner.</hi>

               <p>Albeit, God ſaueth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men after an extraordinary manner, becauſe he is not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ordinarie meanes: Yet he ſaueth after this manner onely thoſe, vnto whome the meanes of ordinary ſaluation hath not béene reuealed.

Hence I conclude, that you cannot expect ſaluation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any extraordinary manner, becauſe the meanes of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſaluation hath béene reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto you long ſince; &amp; this grace God beſtoweth on no man in vaine: for either the knowledge of them worketh ſaluation, or condemnation: nor you cannot expect ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the ordinary way of ſaluation, except you vſe thoſe meanes ordayned thereunto.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:28966:181"/> Whereas you ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God is greater then his iuſtice; and therefore you relie vpon his mercy, &amp; not on your workes and repentance. If you reſpect the mercy and iuſtice of God, as they are in himſelf, his mercy is no greater then his iuſtice. For in God there is nothing greater or leſſe, but all things in the higheſt perfection: But if you reſpect his mercy as hee beſtoweth it on his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: ſo his mercy is far more large then his iuſtice, all his creatures haue taſted of his mercies, but not all of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The holy Angels neuer felt his iuſtice. Your ſelf hath enioyed many of his mercies a long time, but as yet, haue felt little of his iuſtice. Albeit his mercies in this reſpect be greater then his iuſtice: yet
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:28966:181"/> yet doth he beſtow his mercies after a different manner accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different quality of his creatures, as alſo his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be of diuers kinds, ſome ſpirituall, and ſome temporall. His ſpirituall bleſſings, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſaluation, he beſtoweth only vpon thoſe, who truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in Chriſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeriouſly obey the will of God, ſo farre foorth as they know his will. But you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue not, nor endeuour to liue as the word of God directeth you. And therefore although you may, and are partaker of his temporall bleſſings: yet you cannot be capable of his ſpirituall bleſſings, as long as you continue in this damnable eſtate. As for your example of the théefe, who (as you ſay) was ſaued without workes: Firſt,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:28966:182"/> it is not true,<note place="margin">In the firſt Dialogue concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning good workes.</note> he was not ſaued without good works, as elſe where I haue prooued Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it were ſo, your caſe and his are not alike. The meanes of ſaluation were not reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto him, but euen on the day hee was crucified: yet as ſoone as he was conuerted, hée preſently ſhewed forth works. But to you the meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation haue béene knowne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares ſince, yet you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them. Therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you expect but the iuſtice of God in the day of iudgement, and not mercie.</p>
